# c4me-FASS

**1. Overview**<br>
c4me helps students decide where to apply for college. Its functionality is similar to several successful
commercial software systems such as Naviance (licensed by many high schools) and commercial
websites such as CollegeData.com (a service provided by 1st Financial Bank). c4me is for students
planning to get a Bachelor's degree. An interesting challenge, beyond the scope of this project, is to
make a flexible system that can easily be specialized to be suitable for students looking for different
kinds of schools and degrees: undergraduate school, graduate school, law school, medical school, etc.<br>
